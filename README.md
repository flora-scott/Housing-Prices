## General Assembly Project 3 - Ames Housing Data 
This project was completed as part of the General Assembly immersive data science course. The Ames housing data is a comprehensive datset with extensive variables regarding residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The aim of this project was to use exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to inform a regression model in order to predict the price of each home.
