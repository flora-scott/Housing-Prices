## General Assembly Project 3 - Ames Housing Data 
This project, completed as part of the General Assembly immersive data science course, aimed to build a regression model to predict the prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using exploratory data analysis and feature engineering techniques. The project used the Ames housing dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of data on various variables related to residential homes in the Ames area. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). By analyzing and processing the dataset, I aimed to uncover insights and patterns that could inform the development of a robust regression model for predicting home prices. Overall, this project provided a valuable opportunity to apply data science skills to a real-world problem and gain hands-on experience in data analysis and modelling.
